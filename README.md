# üìò Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++ and Python

Welcome to the **DSA Repository**! This repository is dedicated to practicing and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** using both **C++** and **Python**, providing clean, well-documented, and optimized solutions for a wide variety of problems. The aim of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills, prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming, and showcase implementations in both languages side by side for better understanding.

This collection covers essential DSA concepts including Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Binary Search Trees, Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.), Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Searching and Sorting techniques, Bit Manipulation, and Hashing & Maps. Each solution is carefully implemented to highlight both efficiency and clarity.

To use this repository, simply clone it using `git clone https://github.com/saad-deshmukh/Daily-DSA-Practice.git`. You can then run C++ solutions with `g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output` and Python solutions with `python3 filename.py`. The repository is designed to help learners and professionals alike, whether you are brushing up for an interview, preparing for contests, or building a solid foundation in algorithms.

Contributions are always welcome! If you‚Äôd like to add new problems, optimize solutions, or improve documentation, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes in a new branch, and open a pull request.
